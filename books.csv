Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals;Immanuel Kant;books;1;1;0;"""Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals"" by Immanuel Kant is a philosophical treatise written in the late 18th century.

Kant examines the concepts of good will, moral obligation, and the formulation of moral laws that transcend individual inclinations, proposing a framework for understanding morality grounded in rational principles.  The opening of the text presents Kant's exploration of the distinctions between different branches of philosophy, arguing for the necessity of a metaphysic of morals that is independent of empirical influence. He posits that true moral actions must be derived from a pure sense of duty informed by rationality, rather than from self-interest or emotional inclination. Kant introduces the concept of the categorical imperative, which he defines as a universal moral law meant to guide rational beings in their decision-making. This foundational idea illustrates that moral worth arises not from the outcomes of actions but from the motivations rooted in duty that respect the intrinsic value of rational beings as ends in themselves.
